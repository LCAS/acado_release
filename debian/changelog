    Matrix class is used instead, which has de be refactored to include
    sparsity patterns, e.g. simple vector< bool > array and move this
    functionality from ExportVariable.

    In order to cut deps between off-line and CGT ACADO, it is necessary
    to move those 2 classes to another folder. OCP class is the one that
    inherits from model_container in offline ACADO, thus I chose to move
    those two guys over there.
  * Cleaned integrator examples...
    ... as well as integration_algorithm examples -- but I cannot compile
    them so far as they depend on optimal contol set of classes.

    - Names are shorter now, this results in a bit smaller file sizes...
    of the exported code.
  * better support for external models in MATLAB codegen make files
  * update .gitignore files to cleanup output of git status
  * small update to MATLAB example file

    - In the Householder QP decomposition, since #46 <https://github.com/LCAS/acado/issues/46> is solved
    - In the ExportAcadoFunction, because it is giving me more headache
    than helping me debug the code. There is a comment and todo there now.
  * Initialize function return a status value
    + by default, it is 0.
    + qpDUNES interface init function, initializeQpDunes returns status
    via main init function, initialize.
  * Setting the name of exported function call is fixed.
  * Fixed typos in CGT test files.

    … now. Most probably they still don't work...
  * dev and internal -> Now are options..
    .. instead of cached strings
  * Added a closed loop example in Simulink…
    … for the simple crane.
    NOTE: So far it works in Normal mode, but not in

    - Updated wiki pages here and there :)
  * CGT: weighting matrices names changed:
    - S -> W, generated in acadoVariables
    - SN -> WN, generated in acadoVariables
    This is deliberately done because Simulink coder
    is not happy with structure fields with name "S".
    This is not backwards compatible and it is going
    to break old codes.
    Generator changes are only in ExportNLPSolver
    class. Examples and Matlab+Simulink interfaces
    are updated accordingly.

    - Fixed crane mhe and penudulum dae examples
    - Adopted the build system a bit.
  * Removed the test file for the getting_started
    … close loop example in CGT.
    I have added MATLAB and Simulink tests plus
    the dummy file actually works with this one ;).

  * Cleaned export of acado functions.
  * Small fixes in the utilities
    - Update lic info
    - destructor of returnValue: abort -> exit. This is less aggressive and
    scary I would say. However, there is still the memory leak. See #51 <https://github.com/LCAS/acado/issues/51>

  * Working on #38 <https://github.com/LCAS/acado/issues/38>
  * Merge branch 'master' of github.com:mvukov/acado
  * Updated Householder QR
    - Moved back-solve code before the actual solver fcn.
  * added the -std=c99 as a C flag for compilation of ACADO exported code
  * Updated Householder QR based solver and found a bug
    - The solver works for A with dim nRows >= nCols
    - Fixed a bug related to the case w/o reuse feature
    - Disabled export of the solver in case reuse it TRUE, until bugs are

  * Added examples/my_examples
  * Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/mvukov/acado
  * Small fix in the OCP class...
    ... so that it does not report an error when number of intervals in
    the ctor is set to 0 -- this would return a warning when an NLP is
    defined.
  * Updated examples
    ... in a way to really return error codes when an error happens. This
    way we can easily use a new testing feature from the build system.
  * Updated .travis.yml
  * Merge branch 'master' of github.com:mvukov/acado
  * Added exportFolderName field to the ExportModule class...
  * Updated ExportModule class
    - removed setCommonHeaderName() function. setName() of the same class
    will update the commo header name, if needed. This is on the TODO list.

    - Minor cleaning in the mpc_export class.
  * Added acadoCreateFolder function.
    ... Works on UNIX, should be tested on Windows+MSVC.
  * Fixed assertions...
  * Build system updated
    - When we are building "test" target for unit tests,
    __NO_PLOTTING__ def is used to prevent plotting.
    Thus, ACADO_WITH_TESTING should be used with care.
    - BTW: unit tests can be enabled from command
    line with cake:
    cmake -DACADO_WITH_TESTING=ON ..
    - Multi-objective examples are not in unit tests -
    contact Filip to see whether he would like to
    maintain this.
    - Minor polishing…
  * Polished Gnuplot interface…
    - when __NO_PLOTTING__ def is defined, we are
    not plotting anything. This is introduced in the
    case we run unittest.
  * Fixed ASSERT() macro

  * Fixed .travis.yml
  * Updated Travis-CI script to run tests on examples after a successfull build
  * Added automated testing functionality to example apps
  * Prefixed with dev_ examples which give segfaults
  * Added variable initialization in UniformNoise constructor
  * Merge branch 'master' of github.com:mvukov/acado
  * Small bugfix...
  * Working on decoupling standard ACADO and Code Generation Tool (CGT).
    Removed dependency of the standard ACADO on CGT while exporting ACADO
    symbolic functions, i.e. removed dependency on ExportVariable.
    Specific getter/setter functions are moved to the ExportODEFunction now.
    BTW, we should rename ExportODEFunction to ExportACADOFunction.
  * Cleaning the ExportStatement infrastructure.
    Refactored derived classes in order to simplify coding of user classes.
    Main improvement is that certain (helper) functions return a reference
    to a given class.
  * Working on performance issue while exporting "big" expressions.
    There is a performance issue while exporting big functions using
    ExportFunction. The issue is related to setVariableExportName function
    which is called recursively.
    Possible solution is just to call this function in TreeProjection
    class only for an argument of type Power_Int.
  * Updated timestamp of the acado_utils file
  * Replaced notifications of the exported integrator to the new style.
    The debug info can be enable in the user app with:
    Logger::instance().setLogLevel( LVL_DEBUG );
  * Updated copyright notices.
  * Merge branch 'master' of github.com:acado/acado
  * Removed some warnings
  * Merge branch 'isequal-uses-fabs-2' of github.com:roryyorke/acado into roryyorke-isequal-uses-fabs-2
  * Merge branch 'debug-fixes' of github.com:roryyorke/acado into roryyorke-debug-fixes

    Trying to remove unused-comparison with clang...
  * Merge branch 'master' of github.com:acado/acado
  * added the crane MPC example back to MATLAB interface examples
  * Minor: whitespace fix.
  * Bugfix: acadoIsEqual should use fabs() for rel vs abs decision.
    Code previously used maximum of signed arguments to decide whether to
    use relative or absolute tolerance check.  If this function is to also
    be used to compare negative numbers of large magnitude, the absolute
    value of its arguments should be used.
  * WarningFix: remove always-true expression in assertion.
    The variable being checked for non-negativity is an unsigned int.
  * Buildfix: Define __DEBUG__ for CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug.
    This seems like the likely intent of the conditional compilation
    on__DEBUG__ in acado_debugging.hpp, etc.
    It might be better to take a leaf out of <assert.h>, and use NDEBUG
    instead.
  * Bugfix: change isAccessedTransposed() to doAccessTransposed.
    This is a best-guess fix to allow compilation when __DEBUG__ is defined.
  * Bugfix: allow compilation with __DEBUG__.
    The argument idx_ is only used in an ASSERT; ASSERT, in turn, is a
    no-op unless __DEBUG__ is defined.  So, when __DEBUG__ is not defined,
    gcc would warn about an unused variable if the name is declared.
    Allow debug and warning-free non-debug compilation to occur by making
    argument name declaration conditional on __DEBUG__.
  * Update .travis.yml
    Build code in debug configuration...
  * Merge branch 'float-warnings' of github.com:roryyorke/acado into roryyorke-float-warnings

  * WarningFix: remove unused variable nFR and nFX.
  * WarningFix: removed unused local variable nFR, nFX, nAC, and nIAC.
  * WarningFix: Remove unused local variable m.
  * Remove various minor warnings.
    Warnings are either unused argument (removed parameter name),
    unnecessary qualifier (removed const), or recommended braces for
    empty else clause (presumably when ASSERT is defined to be empty).
  * Factor out isExactly* to a PrivateUtils file for reuse in BLASReplacement.cpp.
    As of this check-in there are no more -Wfloat-equals warnings.
  * Remove all float-equality warnings in Matrices.cpp.
    The three types of equality check (to -1, 0, and +1) are replaced by
    inline functions with the float-comparison warnings turned off by a
    gcc pragma.
    It is still to be determined how to make this compatible with other
    compilers.

    We are building now ACADO ONLY the shared lib (by default) on Unix like
    OSs, and static for MSVC. All other libs are built as static and linked
    against the main ACADO lib. That way, we only have to ship one library.
    Building of the static ACADO lib is optional, just set
    ACADO_BUILD_STATIC variable to ON.
    Building of the shared libs for Windows is disabled.
    qpOASES 3.0 build script is heavily modified, just to satisfy needs for
